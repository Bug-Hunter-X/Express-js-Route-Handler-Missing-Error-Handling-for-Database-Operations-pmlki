This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of comprehensive error handling for database or other asynchronous operations. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  The issue is that a database operation to fetch user details could fail, and the original code does not gracefully handle this failure, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
